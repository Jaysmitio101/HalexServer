# HalexServer

Welcome to Halex Server DOCS!
This server is completely designed and developed by Jaysmito Mukherjee.

To Deploy the server run the command: 
java Main deploy
This will deploy a server according to the specifications in the env.config file.
The env.config files specifies the Server characteristics.
There are 4 parameters there.
1- The Web Root Directory[www]= This is a path to any directory on the computer.
2- The Dump Directory[Dump]= This is a internal directory and we recommend not to change this at any case!
3- The Resources Directory[Res]=This has some internal system Resources and should never be deleted or modified!
4- The HTTP Port[80]= This is the port to which the server listens.

This is a very simple Server in Java. Any one can donate to this!
